            <h3>Description</h3>
            Repeated skill invocations and metadata file reads are being classified with high drift scores (0.71), even though these are legitimate system operations.
Root Cause Analysis
htmlgraph-tracker skill invocations are marked as high drift despite being system overhead Reading internal .htmlgraph files (drift-queue.json) is marked as drift These are self-referential activities (HtmlGraph tracking itself)
Impact
Legitimate tracking activities pollute the high-drift queue Makes it harder to identify actual off-topic activities Noise in activity classification reduces signal
Expected Behavior
Skill invocations and internal metadata operations should be excluded from drift calculation or weighted differently:
System skills (htmlgraph-tracker) should not count as drift Reads from .htmlgraph/ directory should have reduced drift weight Self-tracking activities should be classified as "overhead" not "drift"
