            <h3>Description</h3>
            Integration of htmlgraph-tracker skill with the feature-self-tracking workflow. Recent activities show repeated invocations and drift patterns that need to be stabilized and integrated into the development tracking system.
Drift Activities Classified:
Skill invocations: htmlgraph:htmlgraph-tracker (drift: 0.71) Setup chore creation and updates Spike investigations into tracker drift behavior Work item discovery and recent file checks
Context:
As part of dogfooding HtmlGraph development, the system needs to track its own drift activities and classify them into appropriate work items. The htmlgraph tracker skill is being used to automate this process, but the invocation patterns show high drift, indicating the workflow needs refinement.
