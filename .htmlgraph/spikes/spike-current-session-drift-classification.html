            <h3>Description</h3>
            Activities Detected (Drift: 0.71):
Activity File/Operation Type Pattern Read 1 .htmlgraph/chores/chore-drift-classification-consolidation.html Infrastructure metadata read System file read Read 2 .htmlgraph/spikes/spike-classify-high-drift-activities.html Infrastructure metadata read System file read Skill htmlgraph:htmlgraph-tracker activation Tool activation Setup operation Read 3 .htmlgraph/features/feature-self-tracking.html Feature context read Meta-work investigation Glob .htmlgraph/bugs/*.html pattern search Directory exploration Infrastructure investigation
Pattern Recognition:
Multiple reads: 5 activities with 4 read operations No write operations: Pure exploration, no edits Infrastructure focus: All activities target .htmlgraph/* system files Cross-file analysis: Reading feature, chores, spikes, and infrastructure files Meta-work: Investigating the drift classification system itself
Classification Rules Applied:
Rule Condition Matched Evidence Rule 1: SPIKE Repeated reads (3+ files) without edits → Exploratory research ✅ Yes 5 activities, 4 reads, 0 writes Rule 2: SPIKE Cross-file pattern (3+ different files in sequence) → Investigation ✅ Yes chore, spike, feature, bugs files accessed Rule 3: SPIKE Meta-work on infrastructure files (.htmlgraph/*) → System research ✅ Yes All 5 activities target .htmlgraph/* directory Rule 4: FEATURE Read + Write/Edit in sequence → Feature development ❌ No No write operations detected Rule 5: CHORE Skill activation with setup → Maintenance work 🟡 Secondary signal Skill activated but not primary driver
Type: SPIKE
Confidence: 0.85 (High)
Reasoning:
✅ All 3 SPIKE rules matched with high confidence ✅ No FEATURE signals (no write operations) ✅ No BUG signals (multi-file, not single-file focused) ✅ No HOTFIX signals (not urgent, not production-focused) 🟡 Weak CHORE signal (skill activation present but not primary)
While some might classify this as CHORE (infrastructure/maintenance), the pattern is distinctly SPIKE because:
Research-driven: Investigating how drift classification works Exploratory: Reading multiple related files to understand patterns Time-boxed: Spike nature (investigation) rather than ongoing maintenance Decision-focused: Aim is to decide on classification rules/approach Cross-system: Understanding interactions between features, chores, and spikes
This spike represents the current session's activity - classifying the 5 high-drift activities themselves.
Next Steps:
Document this classification in the activity log Link to the consolidation chore for follow-up work Complete this spike by creating the work item (current action) Continue with feature-self-tracking work (parent feature)
