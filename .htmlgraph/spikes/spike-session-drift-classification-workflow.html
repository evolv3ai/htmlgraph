            <h3>Description</h3>
            Investigate and establish a workflow for automatically classifying high-drift activities into appropriate work items. This spike addresses the meta-circular problem of the system detecting its own self-tracking activities as "drift".
High-Drift Activities Classified (drift: 0.71):
Skill activation: htmlgraph:htmlgraph-tracker Read: /Users/shakes/DevProjects/htmlgraph/.htmlgraph/chores/chore-drift-classification-consolidation.html Read: /Users/shakes/DevProjects/htmlgraph/.htmlgraph/spikes/spike-classify-high-drift-activities.html Skill activation: htmlgraph:htmlgraph-tracker (repeated) Skill activation: htmlgraph:htmlgraph-tracker (repeated)
Classification Analysis:
Pattern Detected Multiple metadata reads (2 files) + repeated skill activation + infrastructure focus Context Files accessed are HtmlGraph's own tracking system files - meta-work on the self-tracking infrastructure Classification Signals ✓ Infrastructure/system exploration (not user-facing feature work) ✓ Multiple related .htmlgraph/* files accessed ✓ No source code edits or feature implementation ✓ Investigation of classification system patterns ✓ Cross-file pattern analysis (reading spike + chore together) Classification Rules Applied Rule: Read-only exploration of infrastructure files → SPIKE Rule: Cross-file pattern (reading 2+ related classification files) → Investigation Rule: Meta-work on .htmlgraph/* system → Research/Exploration Rule: No source edits or feature implementation → Not Feature/Chore/Bug Work Item Type SPIKE - Research and investigation into drift classification patterns
Key Insight (Meta-Circular Problem):
The system is detecting its own self-tracking activities as high-drift. This creates a feedback loop where:
feature-self-tracking is active (HtmlGraph tracking itself) System reads drift-queue.json and classification spikes to understand patterns These reads themselves trigger high-drift signals (0.71) Activities get classified as "off-topic" when they're actually system maintenance
Solution needed: Establish rules to distinguish feature drift from meta-work.
Next Steps:
Document Workflow: Create decision tree for classifying high-drift activities Filter Strategy: Exclude .htmlgraph/* system files from drift scoring Rule Base: Establish classification rules (already partially documented in related spikes) Automation: Implement automatic work item creation from drift signals Validation: Test that feature-self-tracking can complete without false positives
