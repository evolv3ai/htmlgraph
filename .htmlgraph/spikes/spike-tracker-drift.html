            <h3>Description</h3>
            Drift detection is flagging repeated activations of the htmlgraph:htmlgraph-tracker skill as high-drift activities (0.71) when the current feature context is feature-self-tracking .
Question: Why is tracker skill activation being classified as off-topic
                when the entire feature is about self-tracking?
Drift classifier may not recognize meta-work (work about tracking) as aligned with feature-self-tracking Skill activation keywords may not be in the feature's keyword pattern matching The drift threshold may be too sensitive for internal/tooling activities
Review drift classification rules in feature-self-tracking.html Analyze why "skill: htmlgraph:htmlgraph-tracker" pattern doesn't match feature keywords Check if drift scoring algorithm accounts for meta-work/tooling activities Determine if threshold (0.71) is appropriate or if it should exclude tracking activities Document findings and recommendations
