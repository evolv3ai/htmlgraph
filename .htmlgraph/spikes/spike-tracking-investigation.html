            <h3>Description</h3>
            Investigation spike triggered by high-drift activity pattern detection. Multiple accesses to tracking feature and skill invocations suggest system exploration/validation needed.
Observations:
Repeated feature-self-tracking.html reads with 0.71 drift score Multiple htmlgraph-tracker skill activations Directory structure exploration in .htmlgraph/
Questions to Answer:
Is the tracking system working as designed? Are drift scores calculated correctly? Should these activities have been classified differently?
