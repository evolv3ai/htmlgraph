# HtmlGraph for AI Agents

**CRITICAL: AI agents must NEVER edit `.htmlgraph/` HTML files directly.**

Use the Python SDK, API, or CLI instead. This ensures all HTML is validated through Pydantic + justhtml.

## 🔄 NOTE: Dogfooding in Action

**IF YOU'RE WORKING ON THE HTMLGRAPH PROJECT ITSELF:**

This project uses HtmlGraph to track its own development. The `.htmlgraph/` directory in this repo is:
- ✅ **Real usage** - Not a demo, actual development tracking
- ✅ **Live examples** - Learn from these patterns for YOUR projects
- ✅ **Our roadmap** - Features we're building for HtmlGraph

**See [CLAUDE.md#dogfooding-context](./CLAUDE.md#dogfooding-context) for full details** on:
- What's general-purpose vs project-specific
- Workflows we should package for all users
- How to distinguish HtmlGraph development from HtmlGraph usage

**IF YOU'RE USING HTMLGRAPH IN YOUR OWN PROJECT:**

Ignore the HtmlGraph-specific features in `.htmlgraph/`. Focus on:
- ✅ SDK patterns shown below
- ✅ Workflow examples (they work for ANY project)
- ✅ Best practices (universal)

---

## Quick Start (Python SDK)

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

# Initialize (auto-discovers .htmlgraph directory)
sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# Get project status
print(sdk.summary(max_items=10))

# Create a feature
feature = sdk.features.create("User Authentication") \
    .set_priority("high") \
    .set_description("Implement OAuth 2.0 login") \
    .add_steps([
        "Create login endpoint",
        "Add JWT middleware",
        "Write integration tests"
    ]) \
    .save()

print(f"Created: {feature.id}")

# Work on it
with sdk.features.edit(feature.id) as f:
    f.status = "in-progress"
    f.agent_assigned = "claude"
    f.steps[0].completed = True

# Query features
high_priority_todos = sdk.features.where(status="todo", priority="high")
for feat in high_priority_todos:
    print(f"- {feat.id}: {feat.title}")
```

---

## Core Principle: NEVER Edit HTML Directly

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**
```python
# NEVER DO THIS
with open(".htmlgraph/features/feature-123.html", "w") as f:
    f.write("<html>...</html>")

# NEVER DO THIS
Edit("/path/to/.htmlgraph/features/feature-123.html", ...)
```

✅ **REQUIRED - Use SDK/API/CLI:**
```python
# SDK (recommended)
with sdk.features.edit("feature-123") as f:
    f.status = "done"

# API
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/features/feature-123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "done"}'

# CLI
uv run htmlgraph feature complete feature-123
```

**Why this matters:**
- Direct edits bypass Pydantic validation
- Bypass justhtml HTML generation
- Break SQLite index sync
- Can corrupt graph structure
- Skip event logging

---

## Python SDK (Recommended)

### Installation

```bash
pip install htmlgraph
# or
uv pip install htmlgraph
```

### Initialization

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

# Auto-discover .htmlgraph directory
sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# Or specify path
sdk = SDK(directory="/path/to/.htmlgraph", agent="claude")
```

### Get Oriented

```python
# Project summary
summary = sdk.summary(max_items=10)
print(summary)

# My workload
workload = sdk.my_work()
print(f"In progress: {workload['in_progress']}")
print(f"Completed: {workload['completed']}")
```

### SDK Method Discovery (Runtime Introspection)

AI agents can't memorize all available methods. Use Python's introspection to explore the SDK at runtime:

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK
import inspect

sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# 1. Discover available collections
collections = [attr for attr in dir(sdk) if not attr.startswith('_')]
print(f"Collections: {collections}")
# → ['bugs', 'chores', 'dep_analytics', 'epics', 'features', 'phases', 'spikes', 'tracks']

# 2. List methods on a collection
methods = [m for m in dir(sdk.features) if not m.startswith('_') and callable(getattr(sdk.features, m))]
print(f"Feature methods: {methods}")
# → ['all', 'assign', 'batch_delete', 'batch_update', 'claim', 'create', 'delete',
#    'edit', 'get', 'mark_done', 'release', 'update', 'where']

# 3. Get method signature
sig = inspect.signature(sdk.features.create)
print(f"create signature: {sig}")
# → (title: str, **kwargs) -> FeatureBuilder

# 4. Get method docstring
print(sdk.features.delete.__doc__)
# → Delete a node.
#   Args: node_id (str) - Node ID to delete
#   Returns: bool - True if deleted, False if not found

# 5. Explore a collection class
from htmlgraph.collections import BaseCollection
available_methods = [m for m in dir(BaseCollection) if not m.startswith('_')]
print(f"BaseCollection methods: {available_methods}")
```

**Common SDK Operations:**

```python
# Collection CRUD operations (all collections support these)
sdk.features.get(id)           # Get by ID
sdk.features.all()              # Get all
sdk.features.where(**filters)   # Query with filters
sdk.features.create(title)      # Create new (returns builder)
sdk.features.edit(id)           # Edit (context manager, auto-saves)
sdk.features.update(node)       # Update (manual)
sdk.features.delete(id)         # Delete by ID

# Batch operations
sdk.features.batch_update(ids, updates)  # Update multiple
sdk.features.batch_delete(ids)           # Delete multiple
sdk.features.mark_done(ids)              # Mark multiple as done
sdk.features.assign(ids, agent)          # Assign multiple to agent

# Agent workflow
sdk.features.claim(id, agent)    # Claim for agent
sdk.features.release(id)         # Release claim
```

**All collections have the same interface:**
- `sdk.features` - Features with builder support
- `sdk.bugs` - Bug reports
- `sdk.chores` - Maintenance tasks
- `sdk.spikes` - Investigation spikes
- `sdk.epics` - Large bodies of work
- `sdk.phases` - Project phases

```python
# Same methods work across all collections
sdk.bugs.delete("bug-001")
sdk.chores.mark_done(["chore-1", "chore-2"])
sdk.spikes.where(status="in-progress")
sdk.epics.assign(["epic-1"], agent="claude")
```

**CLI Help as Reference:**

```bash
# See all feature commands
uv run htmlgraph feature --help
# Shows: create, start, complete, delete, claim, release, list, etc.

# Most CLI commands have SDK equivalents:
# CLI: uv run htmlgraph feature delete feat-001
# SDK: sdk.features.delete("feat-001")
```

### Create Features

```python
# Fluent builder pattern
feature = sdk.features.create("Implement Dark Mode") \
    .set_priority("high") \
    .set_description("Add dark theme toggle to settings") \
    .add_steps([
        "Design color palette",
        "Create CSS variables",
        "Implement toggle component",
        "Add persistence (localStorage)",
        "Test across pages"
    ]) \
    .set_track("ui-improvements") \
    .save()

print(f"Created: {feature.id}")
```

### Work on Features

```python
# Context manager auto-saves on exit
with sdk.features.edit("feature-001") as f:
    f.status = "in-progress"
    f.agent_assigned = "claude"
    f.steps[0].completed = True
    f.steps[0].agent = "claude"

# Check if all steps done
with sdk.features.edit("feature-001") as f:
    all_done = all(s.completed for s in f.steps)
    if all_done:
        f.status = "done"
```

### Query Features

```python
# Declarative filtering
high_priority = sdk.features.where(status="todo", priority="high")
my_work = sdk.features.where(assigned_to="claude", status="in-progress")
track_features = sdk.features.where(track="auth-track")

# Get all
all_features = sdk.features.all()

# Get by ID
feature = sdk.features.get("feature-001")
```

### Batch Operations

```python
# Mark multiple as done
count = sdk.features.mark_done([
    "feature-001",
    "feature-002",
    "feature-003"
])
print(f"Marked {count} features as done")

# Assign multiple to agent
count = sdk.features.assign(
    ["feature-004", "feature-005"],
    agent="claude"
)
print(f"Assigned {count} features to claude")
```

### Get Next Task

```python
# Automatically find and claim next task
task = sdk.next_task(priority="high", auto_claim=True)

if task:
    print(f"Working on: {task.id} - {task.title}")

    # Work on it
    with sdk.features.edit(task.id) as f:
        for i, step in enumerate(f.steps):
            if not step.completed:
                # Do the work...
                step.completed = True
                step.agent = "claude"
                print(f"✓ Completed: {step.description}")
                break
else:
    print("No high-priority tasks available")
```

### Reload Data

```python
# Refresh from disk if files changed externally
sdk.reload()
```

---

## REST API (Alternative)

### Start Server

```bash
uv run htmlgraph serve
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

### Endpoints

#### Get All Features
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/query?type=feature
```

#### Get Feature by ID
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/features/feature-001
```

#### Create Feature
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/features \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "User Authentication",
    "priority": "high",
    "status": "todo",
    "steps": [
      {"description": "Create login endpoint"},
      {"description": "Add JWT middleware"}
    ]
  }'
```

#### Update Feature
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/features/feature-001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "in-progress"}'
```

#### Complete Step
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/features/feature-001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"complete_step": 0}'
```

**Step numbering is 0-based** (first step = 0, second step = 1, etc.)

---

## CLI (Alternative)

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `uv run` to ensure correct environment.

### Check Status
```bash
uv run htmlgraph status
uv run htmlgraph feature list
```

### Start Feature
```bash
uv run htmlgraph feature start <feature-id>
```

### Set Primary Feature
```bash
# When multiple features are active
uv run htmlgraph feature primary <feature-id>
```

### Complete Feature
```bash
uv run htmlgraph feature complete <feature-id>
```

### Server
```bash
uv run htmlgraph serve
```

## Decision Matrix: SDK vs API vs CLI

| Use Case | Recommended Interface |
|----------|----------------------|
| AI agent writing code | **SDK** (most ergonomic) |
| Scripting/automation | SDK or CLI |
| Manual testing | CLI or Dashboard |
| External integration | REST API |
| Debugging | CLI + Dashboard |

---

## Best Practices for AI Agents

### 1. Always Use SDK in Python Code

```python
# ✅ GOOD
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent="claude")
feature = sdk.features.create("Title").save()

# ❌ BAD - Don't use low-level API directly
from htmlgraph import HtmlGraph, Node
graph = HtmlGraph(".htmlgraph/features")
node = Node(id="...", title="...")
graph.add(node)
```

---

## Debugging & Quality

**See [DEBUGGING.md](./DEBUGGING.md) for the complete debugging guide**

HtmlGraph provides specialized debugging agents for systematic problem-solving:

### Debugging Agents

- **Researcher Agent** (`packages/claude-plugin/agents/researcher.md`)
  - Research documentation BEFORE implementing solutions
  - Use for: Unfamiliar errors, Claude Code hooks/plugins, multiple failed attempts

- **Debugger Agent** (`packages/claude-plugin/agents/debugger.md`)
  - Systematically analyze and resolve errors
  - Use for: Known errors, test failures, reproduction needed

- **Test Runner Agent** (`packages/claude-plugin/agents/test-runner.md`)
  - Validate all changes, enforce quality gates
  - Use for: Pre-commit validation, deployment, regression prevention

### Tool Selection Matrix

| Scenario | Use This Agent | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Unfamiliar error | Researcher | Research docs first |
| Claude Code hooks issue | Researcher | Official guidance needed |
| Error with known cause | Debugger | Systematic root cause analysis |
| Before committing | Test Runner | Validate quality gates |
| Multiple failed attempts | Researcher | Stop guessing, start researching |

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Research first
packages/claude-plugin/agents/researcher.md

# Debug systematically
packages/claude-plugin/agents/debugger.md

# Validate changes
packages/claude-plugin/agents/test-runner.md
```

---

### 2. Use Context Managers (Auto-Save)

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Auto-saves on exit
with sdk.features.edit("feature-001") as f:
    f.status = "done"

# ❌ BAD - Easy to forget to save
feature = sdk.features.get("feature-001")
feature.status = "done"
# Forgot to call sdk._graph.update(feature)!
```

### 3. Use Declarative Queries

```python
# ✅ GOOD
todos = sdk.features.where(status="todo", priority="high")

# ❌ BAD - Manual filtering
todos = [
    f for f in sdk.features.all()
    if f.status == "todo" and f.priority == "high"
]
```

### 4. Use Batch Operations

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Single operation
sdk.features.mark_done(["feat-001", "feat-002", "feat-003"])

# ❌ BAD - Multiple operations
for id in ["feat-001", "feat-002", "feat-003"]:
    with sdk.features.edit(id) as f:
        f.status = "done"
```

### 5. Check Status Before Working

```python
# Get orientation
print(sdk.summary())

# Check your workload
workload = sdk.my_work()
if workload['in_progress'] > 5:
    print("Already at capacity!")
```

### 6. Document Decisions

```python
# If significant architectural decision
# Document in feature content
with sdk.features.edit("feature-001") as f:
    f.content += """
    <h3>Decision: Use JWT instead of sessions</h3>
    <p>Rationale: Stateless, easier to scale horizontally</p>
    """
```

## Complete Workflow Example

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

def ai_agent_workflow():
    """Realistic AI agent workflow."""

    # 1. Initialize
    sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

    # 2. Get oriented
    print("=== Project Summary ===")
    print(sdk.summary(max_items=10))

    # 3. Check workload
    workload = sdk.my_work()
    print(f"\nMy Workload:")
    print(f"  In progress: {workload['in_progress']}")
    print(f"  Completed: {workload['completed']}")

    if workload['in_progress'] > 5:
        print("\n⚠️  Already at capacity!")
        return

    # 4. Get next task
    task = sdk.next_task(priority="high", auto_claim=True)

    if not task:
        print("\n✅ No high-priority tasks available")
        return

    print(f"\n=== Working on: {task.title} ===")

    # 5. Work on task
    with sdk.features.edit(task.id) as feature:
        print(f"\nSteps:")
        for i, step in enumerate(feature.steps):
            if step.completed:
                print(f"  ✅ {step.description}")
            else:
                print(f"  ⏳ {step.description}")

                # Do the work here...
                # (implementation details)

                # Mark step complete
                step.completed = True
                step.agent = "claude"
                print(f"  ✓ Completed: {step.description}")
                break

        # Check if all done
        all_done = all(s.completed for s in feature.steps)
        if all_done:
            feature.status = "done"
            print(f"\n✅ Feature complete: {feature.id}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ai_agent_workflow()
```

## Orchestrator Mode

### What is Orchestrator Mode?

Orchestrator Mode is an **enforcement system** that guides AI agents to delegate low-cognitive, context-filling work to specialized subagents using the Task tool. When enabled, certain operations are blocked or warned against to encourage efficient workflow patterns.

**Key Principles:**
- **Context preservation** - Keep orchestrator context for high-level decisions
- **Parallel execution** - Delegate to subagents for concurrent work
- **Pattern enforcement** - Block operations that fill context unnecessarily
- **Progressive guidance** - Start with warnings, escalate to blocks

### Quick Start

```bash
# Enable orchestrator mode (strict enforcement)
uv run htmlgraph orchestrator enable

# Enable with guidance only (warnings, no blocks)
uv run htmlgraph orchestrator enable --mode guidance

# Check current status
uv run htmlgraph orchestrator status

# Disable orchestrator mode
uv run htmlgraph orchestrator disable
```

### How It Works

Orchestrator Mode uses HtmlGraph's **PreToolUse hook** to intercept tool calls before execution:

1. **Tool call initiated** - Agent attempts to use a tool (e.g., Bash, Edit, Grep)
2. **Hook intercepts** - PreToolUse hook examines the tool and context
3. **Classification** - Determines if operation should be allowed, warned, or blocked
4. **Guidance** - Provides feedback and suggests delegation
5. **Execution** - Either allows the operation or blocks it (depending on mode)

**Enforcement Modes:**

- **Strict** (default) - Blocks disallowed operations, agent must delegate
- **Guidance** - Shows warnings but allows all operations (learning mode)

### Operation Classification

#### ✅ Always Allowed (No restrictions)

- **SDK Operations** - `sdk.features.create()`, `sdk.features.edit()`, etc.
- **Task Tool** - Delegation to subagents
- **TodoWrite** - Task list management
- **Read** - Reading files (≤5 per session)
- **Strategic Analysis** - `dep_analytics`, `recommend_next_work()`

#### ⚠️ Warned (Allowed with guidance)

- **Bash** - First 3 calls allowed, then warned
- **Edit** - First 5 calls allowed, then warned
- **Grep** - First 5 calls allowed, then warned
- **Glob** - First 5 calls allowed, then warned

#### 🚫 Blocked in Strict Mode

- **Excessive Read** - More than 5 file reads
- **Excessive Bash** - More than 3 bash calls
- **Excessive Edit** - More than 5 file edits
- **Excessive Grep** - More than 5 searches
- **Excessive Glob** - More than 5 pattern matches

### Examples

#### ❌ Direct Execution (Fills Context)

```python
# Orchestrator runs tests directly - sequential, fills context
result1 = bash("uv run pytest tests/unit/")
result2 = bash("uv run pytest tests/integration/")
result3 = bash("uv run pytest tests/e2e/")
# Result: 3 sequential calls, full output in orchestrator context
# Orchestrator mode: BLOCKED after 3rd call
```

#### ✅ Delegated Execution (Preserves Context)

```python
# Orchestrator spawns parallel subagents
Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="Run unit tests and report only failures"
)
Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="Run integration tests and report only failures"
)
Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="Run e2e tests and report only failures"
)
# Result: 3 parallel agents, orchestrator gets summaries only
# Orchestrator mode: ALLOWED
```

#### ❌ Multiple File Edits (Fills Context)

```python
# Orchestrator edits 10 files
for file in files:
    Edit(file, ...)  # Each edit adds to context
# Orchestrator mode: BLOCKED after 5 edits
```

#### ✅ Delegated File Edits

```python
# Orchestrator delegates to subagent
Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt=f"Update all files in {files} to use new API. Report summary of changes."
)
# Orchestrator mode: ALLOWED
```

### Configuration

Orchestrator mode is configured via `.htmlgraph/orchestrator.json`:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "mode": "strict",
  "thresholds": {
    "max_bash_calls": 3,
    "max_file_reads": 5,
    "max_file_edits": 5,
    "max_grep_calls": 5,
    "max_glob_calls": 5
  },
  "allowed_tools": [
    "SDK",
    "Task",
    "TodoWrite"
  ]
}
```

**Customization:**

```bash
# Edit thresholds directly
vim .htmlgraph/orchestrator.json

# Or use CLI (future)
uv run htmlgraph orchestrator set-threshold max_bash_calls 5
```

### When to Use Orchestrator Mode

**Use Orchestrator Mode When:**
- ✅ Managing complex multi-step workflows
- ✅ Coordinating multiple features or phases
- ✅ Running comprehensive test suites
- ✅ Large-scale refactoring across many files
- ✅ Exploratory analysis of large codebases

**Skip Orchestrator Mode When:**
- ❌ Working on a single, focused task
- ❌ Quick bug fixes (1-2 files)
- ❌ Prototyping or experimentation
- ❌ Writing documentation

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: Operation blocked but I need to do it**

Solution: Use `--mode guidance` for warnings only:
```bash
uv run htmlgraph orchestrator enable --mode guidance
```

**Problem: Too many operations blocked**

Solution: Increase thresholds or disable temporarily:
```bash
# Increase thresholds
vim .htmlgraph/orchestrator.json  # Edit max_* values

# Or disable temporarily
uv run htmlgraph orchestrator disable
```

**Problem: Don't understand why operation was blocked**

Solution: Check the guidance message - it explains why and suggests delegation:
```
⚠️ ORCHESTRATOR MODE: Exceeded threshold for Bash calls (3/3)
Suggestion: Delegate to subagent using Task tool
Example: Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="Run pytest and report failures")
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start with Guidance Mode** - Learn the patterns before enforcing
   ```bash
   uv run htmlgraph orchestrator enable --mode guidance
   ```

2. **Delegate Early** - Don't wait until you hit thresholds
   ```python
   # As soon as you see multiple similar operations
   Task(prompt="Handle all test files in tests/ directory")
   ```

3. **Use Task Tool Liberally** - It's designed for this
   ```python
   # Good delegation patterns
   Task(prompt="Explore codebase and find all API endpoints")
   Task(prompt="Run full test suite and report failures")
   Task(prompt="Update all imports to use new module structure")
   ```

4. **Monitor Context Usage** - Check your context regularly
   ```python
   # If you're filling context, delegate
   if len(messages) > 50:
       Task(prompt="Complete this implementation")
   ```

5. **Review Guidance Messages** - Learn from warnings
   ```
   # Each warning teaches a pattern
   ⚠️ Orchestrator mode suggests delegation
   # → Adjust your workflow
   ```

### FAQ

**Q: Will this slow me down?**
A: No - delegation is faster (parallel) and preserves context for high-level decisions.

**Q: Can I bypass orchestrator mode?**
A: Yes - use `--mode guidance` or disable it. But you'll lose the benefits.

**Q: What if I disagree with a block?**
A: Open an issue - we want to improve the classification logic.

**Q: Does this work with all AI agents?**
A: Yes - any agent using HtmlGraph will respect orchestrator mode.

**Q: How do I know it's working?**
A: Check status: `uv run htmlgraph orchestrator status`

## Orchestrator Success Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parallel Test Execution
**❌ Direct (Sequential)**:
```python
# Orchestrator runs tests directly - fills context
uv run pytest tests/unit/
uv run pytest tests/integration/
uv run pytest tests/e2e/
# Result: 3 sequential calls, full output in orchestrator context
```

**✅ Delegated (Parallel)**:
```python
# Orchestrator spawns parallel subagents
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="Run unit tests and report failures")
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="Run integration tests and report failures")
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="Run e2e tests and report failures")
# Result: 3 parallel agents, orchestrator gets summaries only
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-File Implementation
**❌ Direct**: Orchestrator edits 5 files, context fills with diffs
**✅ Delegated**: Subagent handles all edits, returns summary

### Pattern 3: Codebase Exploration
**❌ Direct**: 10 Grep/Glob calls pollute orchestrator context
**✅ Delegated**: `Task(subagent_type="Explore")` returns structured findings

### Why Delegation Wins
| Metric | Direct | Delegated |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Context used | HIGH | LOW |
| Parallelization | None | Full |
| Work tracking | Manual | Automatic |
| Learning/Patterns | Lost | Captured |

## API Reference

### SDK Class

```python
class SDK:
    def __init__(
        self,

## Agent Handoff Context

Handoff enables smooth context transfer between agents when a task requires different expertise.

### Marking a Task for Handoff

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# Complete work and hand off
with sdk.features.edit("feature-001") as feature:
    feature.steps[0].completed = True

# Trigger handoff with context
manager = sdk._session_manager
manager.create_handoff(
    feature_id="feature-001",
    reason="blocked_on_testing",
    notes="Implementation complete. Needs comprehensive test coverage.",
    agent="claude"
)

# Feature now shows handoff context for next agent
feature = sdk.features.get("feature-001")
print(feature.previous_agent)  # "claude"
print(feature.handoff_reason)  # "blocked_on_testing"
print(feature.handoff_notes)   # Full context
```

### Receiving a Handoff

When claiming a handoff task, the previous agent's context is available:

```python
sdk = SDK(agent="bob")

# Get handoff task
feature = sdk.features.get("feature-001")

# View handoff context
context = feature.to_context()
# Output:
# # feature-001: Implement API
# Status: in-progress | Priority: high
# ⚠️  Handoff from: claude
# Reason: blocked_on_testing
# Notes: Implementation complete. Needs comprehensive test coverage.
# Progress: 1/3 steps

# Mark as received and continue
with sdk.features.edit("feature-001") as f:
    f.agent_assigned = "bob"
    f.steps[1].completed = True
```

### Handoff Best Practices

1. **Provide context**: Always include `notes` with relevant decisions/blockers
2. **Mark progress**: Complete steps before handoff so next agent knows what's done
3. **Set clear reason**: Use structured reasons: `blocked_on_*`, `needs_*`, `ready_for_*`
4. **Preserve history**: Handoff chain shows full development history

## Agent Routing & Capabilities

Capability-based routing automatically assigns tasks to agents with matching skills.

### Register Agent Capabilities

```python
from htmlgraph.routing import AgentCapabilityRegistry

registry = AgentCapabilityRegistry()

# Register agents with their capabilities
registry.register_agent("alice", ["python", "backend", "databases"])
registry.register_agent("bob", ["python", "frontend", "ui"])
registry.register_agent("charlie", ["testing", "quality-assurance"])
```

### Define Task Requirements

```python
from htmlgraph.models import Node

task = Node(
    id="api-task",
    title="Build User API",
    required_capabilities=["python", "backend", "databases"]
)
```

### Route Task to Best Agent

```python
from htmlgraph.routing import CapabilityMatcher

# Find best agent for task
agents = registry.get_all_agents()
best_agent = CapabilityMatcher.find_best_agent(agents, task)

print(f"Best agent: {best_agent.agent_id}")  # "alice"
print(f"Match score: {best_agent.capabilities}")
```

### Routing with Workload Balancing

```python
# Set current workload
registry.set_wip("alice", 4)  # Alice has 4 tasks in progress
registry.set_wip("bob", 1)    # Bob has 1 task

# Routing considers workload (alice is busier)
best_agent = CapabilityMatcher.find_best_agent(agents, task)
# Might choose bob if bob has matching skills (workload penalty applied)
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK
from htmlgraph.routing import AgentCapabilityRegistry, route_task_to_agent

sdk = SDK(agent="coordinator")
registry = AgentCapabilityRegistry()

# Register team
registry.register_agent("architect", ["architecture", "design"])
registry.register_agent("backend", ["python", "backend"])
registry.register_agent("qa", ["testing", "quality"])

# Get tasks needing assignment
tasks = sdk.features.where(status="todo")

# Route each task
for task in tasks:
    best_agent, score = route_task_to_agent(task, registry)
    if best_agent:
        # Assign to best agent
        print(f"Assigning {task.id} to {best_agent.agent_id} (score: {score})")
```

### Capability Scoring Algorithm

Scoring is 0-based (higher = better fit):

- **Exact match**: +100 per matching capability
- **No match**: -50 per missing capability
- **Extra capabilities**: +10 per bonus capability
- **Workload penalty**: -5 per task in progress
- **At capacity**: -100 (hard penalty for full WIP)

Example:
- Task needs: `["python", "testing"]`
- Agent has: `["python", "testing", "documentation"]`
- Score: (2 × 100) + (1 × 10) = 210 (excellent match)

## Claude Code Transcript Integration

HtmlGraph integrates with Claude Code transcripts to capture development context and enable analytics.

### What Are Transcripts?

Claude Code stores conversation transcripts as JSONL files in:
```
~/.claude/projects/[encoded-path]/[session-uuid].jsonl
```

These contain:
- User messages and assistant responses
- Tool calls (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- Thinking traces (optional)
- Timestamps and session metadata
- Git branch context

### Why Transcripts Matter

Transcripts capture the **reasoning** behind code changes:
- **What was asked for** - Original user prompts
- **What Claude suggested** - AI recommendations and alternatives
- **Decisions made** - Why certain approaches were chosen
- **Implementation context** - Claude's reasoning during development

### CLI Commands

```bash
# List available transcripts
uv run htmlgraph transcript list [--limit N]

# Import a transcript session
uv run htmlgraph transcript import SESSION_ID [--link-feature FEAT_ID]

# Auto-link transcripts by git branch
uv run htmlgraph transcript auto-link [--branch BRANCH]

# Export transcript to HTML
uv run htmlgraph transcript export SESSION_ID -o output.html

# Get session health metrics
uv run htmlgraph transcript health SESSION_ID

# Detect workflow patterns
uv run htmlgraph transcript patterns [--transcript-id ID]

# Show tool transition matrix
uv run htmlgraph transcript transitions

# Get improvement recommendations
uv run htmlgraph transcript recommendations

# Comprehensive analytics
uv run htmlgraph transcript insights

# Track-level aggregation
uv run htmlgraph transcript track-stats TRACK_ID
```

### Analytics Features

**Session Health Scoring:**
- Efficiency score (tool calls per user message)
- Retry rate (consecutive same-tool usage)
- Context rebuilds (repeated file reads)
- Tool diversity (variety of tools used)

**Pattern Detection:**
- Anti-patterns: 4x Bash, 3x Edit, 3x Grep, 4x Read (repeated)
- Optimal patterns: Grep→Read, Read→Edit, Edit→Bash

**Track-Level Aggregation:**
- Aggregate stats across all sessions in a track
- Health trends (improving/stable/declining)
- Combined tool frequency and transitions

### PreToolUse Hook Integration

HtmlGraph's PreToolUse hook provides real-time guidance based on transcript patterns:

```python
# Active learning from tool history
ANTI_PATTERNS = {
    ("Bash", "Bash", "Bash", "Bash"): "4 consecutive Bash commands. Check for errors.",
    ("Edit", "Edit", "Edit"): "3 consecutive Edits. Consider batching.",
}

OPTIMAL_PATTERNS = {
    ("Grep", "Read"): "Good: Search then read - efficient exploration.",
    ("Read", "Edit"): "Good: Read then edit - informed changes.",
}
```

The hook tracks tool usage and provides guidance (never blocks) to improve workflows.

### HTML Export

Export transcripts to browser-viewable HTML:

```bash
uv run htmlgraph transcript export SESSION_ID -o transcript.html --include-thinking
```

Compatible with [claude-code-transcripts](https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts) format.

---

## Troubleshooting

### SDK not finding .htmlgraph directory

```python
# Specify path explicitly
sdk = SDK(directory="/path/to/project/.htmlgraph", agent="claude")
```

### Feature not found

```python
# Reload from disk
sdk.reload()
feature = sdk.features.get("feature-001")
```

### Changes not persisting

```python
# Make sure you're using context manager
with sdk.features.edit("feature-001") as f:
    f.status = "done"  # Auto-saves on exit

# Or manually save
feature = sdk.features.get("feature-001")
feature.status = "done"
sdk._graph.update(feature)  # Manual save
```

## Deployment & Release

### Using the Deployment Script (FLEXIBLE OPTIONS)

HtmlGraph includes `scripts/deploy-all.sh` with multiple modes for different scenarios:

**Quick Usage:**
```bash
# Documentation changes only (commit + push)
./scripts/deploy-all.sh --docs-only

# Full release
./scripts/deploy-all.sh 0.7.1

# Preview what would happen
./scripts/deploy-all.sh --dry-run

# Show all options
./scripts/deploy-all.sh --help
```

**Available Flags:**
- `--docs-only` - Only commit and push to git (skip build/publish)
- `--build-only` - Only build package (skip git/publish/install)
- `--skip-pypi` - Skip PyPI publishing step
- `--skip-plugins` - Skip plugin update steps
- `--dry-run` - Show what would happen without executing

**What full deployment does (7 steps):**
1. **Git Push** - Pushes commits and tags to origin/main
2. **Build Package** - Creates wheel and source distributions with `uv build`
3. **Publish to PyPI** - Uploads to PyPI using token from .env
4. **Local Install** - Installs latest version locally with pip
5. **Update Claude Plugin** - Runs `claude plugin update htmlgraph`
6. **Update Gemini Extension** - Updates version in gemini-extension.json
7. **Update Codex Skill** - Checks for Codex and updates if present

**Prerequisites:**

Set your PyPI token in `.env` file:
```bash
PyPI_API_TOKEN=pypi-YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

**Complete Release Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Update version numbers
# Edit: pyproject.toml, __init__.py, plugin.json, gemini-extension.json

# 2. Commit version bump
git add pyproject.toml src/python/htmlgraph/__init__.py \
  packages/claude-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json \
  packages/gemini-extension/gemini-extension.json
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.7.1"

# 3. Create git tag
git tag v0.7.1
git push origin main --tags

# 4. Run deployment script
./scripts/deploy-all.sh 0.7.1
```

**Manual Steps (if script fails):**

```bash
# Build
uv build

# Publish to PyPI
source .env
uv publish dist/htmlgraph-0.7.1* --token "$PyPI_API_TOKEN"

# Install locally
pip install --upgrade htmlgraph==0.7.1

# Update plugins manually
claude plugin update htmlgraph
```

**Verify Deployment:**

```bash
# Check PyPI
open https://pypi.org/project/htmlgraph/

# Verify local install
python -c "import htmlgraph; print(htmlgraph.__version__)"

# Test Claude plugin
claude plugin list | grep htmlgraph
```

---

### Generalized Deployment System (NEW!)

**For YOUR Projects** - HtmlGraph now includes a flexible deployment system that any project can use!

#### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize deployment configuration
htmlgraph deploy init

# 2. Edit htmlgraph-deploy.toml to customize
# 3. Run deployment
htmlgraph deploy run

# Or with flags
htmlgraph deploy run --dry-run        # Preview
htmlgraph deploy run --build-only     # Just build
htmlgraph deploy run --docs-only      # Just git push
```

#### Configuration

The `htmlgraph deploy init` command creates a template configuration file:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
pypi_package = "my-package"

[deployment]
# Customize which steps to run and in what order
steps = [
    "git-push",
    "build",
    "pypi-publish",
    "local-install",
    "update-plugins"
]

[deployment.git]
branch = "main"
remote = "origin"
push_tags = true

[deployment.build]
command = "uv build"  # Or "python -m build", "poetry build", etc.
clean_dist = true

[deployment.pypi]
token_env_var = "PyPI_API_TOKEN"
wait_after_publish = 10

[deployment.plugins]
# Update platform-specific plugins
claude = "claude plugin update {package}"
gemini = "gemini extensions update {package}"

[deployment.hooks]
# Custom commands to run at various stages
pre_build = ["python scripts/update_version.py {version}"]
post_build = []
pre_publish = []
post_publish = ["python scripts/notify_release.py {version}"]
```

#### Available Steps

1. **git-push** - Push commits and tags to remote
2. **build** - Build package distributions
3. **pypi-publish** - Upload to PyPI
4. **local-install** - Install package locally
5. **update-plugins** - Update platform-specific plugins

#### Custom Hooks

Add custom commands at key points in the deployment process:

- **pre_build** - Before building (e.g., update version files)
- **post_build** - After building (e.g., validate artifacts)
- **pre_publish** - Before PyPI publish (e.g., run tests)
- **post_publish** - After publishing (e.g., notify Slack, create GitHub release)

Hooks support placeholders:
- `{version}` - Current package version
- `{package}` - Package name

#### Deployment Modes

```bash
# Full deployment (all steps)
htmlgraph deploy run

# Documentation only (git push)
htmlgraph deploy run --docs-only

# Build only (no git, no publish)
htmlgraph deploy run --build-only

# Skip specific steps
htmlgraph deploy run --skip-pypi
htmlgraph deploy run --skip-plugins

# Preview mode (no changes)
htmlgraph deploy run --dry-run
```

#### Example: Flask Project Deployment

```toml
[project]
name = "my-flask-app"
pypi_package = "my-flask-app"

[deployment]
steps = [
    "git-push",
    "build",
    "pypi-publish",
    "local-install"
]

[deployment.build]
command = "python -m build"
clean_dist = true

[deployment.hooks]
pre_build = [
    "python -m pytest",  # Run tests first
    "python scripts/bump_version.py {version}"
]
post_publish = [
    "python scripts/deploy_docs.py",
    "curl -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/... -d 'Released {version}'"
]
```

#### Example: Multi-Platform Plugin

```toml
[deployment.plugins]
# Update multiple platforms
claude = "claude plugin update {package}"
gemini = "gemini extensions update {package}"
codex = "codex skills update {package}"
vscode = "vsce publish"
```

#### Benefits Over Shell Scripts

- ✅ **Portable** - Works across platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- ✅ **Configurable** - TOML config instead of editing bash
- ✅ **Extensible** - Custom hooks for any workflow
- ✅ **Safe** - Dry-run mode and step-by-step execution
- ✅ **Integrated** - Works with htmlgraph tracking
- ✅ **Reusable** - Share config across projects

---

## Documentation Synchronization

### Memory File Sync Tool

HtmlGraph includes `scripts/sync_memory_files.py` to maintain consistency across AI agent documentation files:

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check if files are synchronized
python scripts/sync_memory_files.py --check

# Generate platform-specific file
python scripts/sync_memory_files.py --generate gemini
python scripts/sync_memory_files.py --generate claude
python scripts/sync_memory_files.py --generate codex

# Overwrite existing file
python scripts/sync_memory_files.py --generate gemini --force
```

**What it checks:**
- ✅ AGENTS.md exists (required central documentation)
- ✅ Platform files reference AGENTS.md properly
- ✅ Consistency across Claude, Gemini, Codex docs

**File structure:**
```
project/
├── AGENTS.md                    # Central documentation (SDK, deployment, workflows)
├── CLAUDE.md                    # Project vision + references AGENTS.md
├── GEMINI.md                    # Gemini-specific + references AGENTS.md
└── packages/
    ├── claude-plugin/skills/htmlgraph-tracker/SKILL.md
    ├── gemini-extension/GEMINI.md
    └── codex-skill/SKILL.md
```

**Why this matters:**
- Single source of truth (AGENTS.md)
- Platform files add platform-specific notes
- Easy maintenance (update once, not 3+ times)
- Automated validation

---

## Git-Based Continuity Spine

### Overview

HtmlGraph uses Git as a universal continuity spine that enables agent-agnostic session tracking. This means HtmlGraph works with ANY coding agent (Claude, Codex, Cursor, vim), not just those with native integrations.

**Core Principle**: Git commits are universal continuity points that work regardless of which agent wrote the code.

### Quick Start

**Install Git hooks**:
```bash
htmlgraph install-hooks
```

**What this does**:
- Installs hooks in `.git/hooks/` (symlinked to `.htmlgraph/hooks/`)
- Tracks commits, checkouts, merges, pushes automatically
- Links sessions across agents via commit graph
- Works offline (Git is local)

### How It Works

**Git hooks log events** to `.htmlgraph/events/`:

```
Session S1 (Claude)          Session S2 (Codex)         Session S3 (Claude)
─────────────────────       ─────────────────────      ─────────────────────
start_commit: abc1          start_commit: abc3         start_commit: abc5
continued_from: None        continued_from: S1         continued_from: S2

Events:                     Events:                    Events:
  - Edit file               - Edit file                - Edit file
  - GitCommit abc1          - GitCommit abc3           - GitCommit abc5
  - GitCommit abc2          - GitCommit abc4           - GitCommit abc6

Git Commit Graph:
abc1 → abc2 → abc3 → abc4 → abc5 → abc6
 │             │             │
S1            S2            S3
```

**Session continuity survives crashes** - Git history is durable.

### Commit Message Convention

Include feature references for better attribution:

```bash
# Good - explicit feature reference
git commit -m "feat: add login endpoint (feature-auth-001)"

# Better - structured format
git commit -m "feat: add login endpoint

Implements: feature-auth-001
Related: feature-session-002
"
```

### Feature File Patterns

Add file patterns to features for automatic commit attribution:

```python
feature = sdk.features.create("User Authentication") \
    .set_file_patterns([
        "src/auth/**/*.py",
        "tests/auth/**/*.py"
    ]) \
    .save()

# Now commits touching these files auto-attribute to this feature
```

### Cross-Agent Collaboration

**Example: Work starts in Claude, continues in Codex**:

```python
# Day 1 (Claude)
session_s1 = sdk.sessions.start(agent="claude")
# ... work ...
git commit -m "feat: start auth (feature-auth-001)"  # → abc123
sdk.sessions.end(session_s1.id)

# Day 2 (Codex - different agent!)
session_s2 = sdk.sessions.start(
    agent="codex",
    continued_from=session_s1.id  # Optional but helpful
)
# ... work ...
git commit -m "feat: continue auth (feature-auth-001)"  # → def456

# Query for full history (works across agents)
sessions = sdk.get_feature_sessions("feature-auth-001")
# → [Session(agent="claude"), Session(agent="codex")]
```

### Event Types

**GitCommit** - Primary continuity anchor:
```json
{
  "type": "GitCommit",
  "commit_hash": "abc123",
  "branch": "main",
  "author": "alice@example.com",
  "message": "feat: add user authentication",
  "files_changed": ["src/auth/login.py"],
  "insertions": 145,
  "deletions": 23,
  "features": ["feature-auth-001"]
}
```

**GitCheckout** - Branch continuity:
```json
{
  "type": "GitCheckout",
  "from_branch": "main",
  "to_branch": "feature/auth"
}
```

**GitMerge** - Integration events:
```json
{
  "type": "GitMerge",
  "orig_head": "abc123",
  "new_head": "def456"
}
```

**GitPush** - Team boundaries:
```json
{
  "type": "GitPush",
  "remote_name": "origin",
  "updates": [...]
}
```

### Agent Compatibility

| Agent | Git Hooks | Session Tracking | Notes |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Claude Code | ✅ | ✅ | Full integration via plugin |
| GitHub Codex | ✅ | ✅ | Git hooks + SDK |
| Google Gemini | ✅ | ✅ | Git hooks + SDK |
| Cursor | ✅ | ✅ | Git hooks + SDK |
| vim/emacs | ✅ | ⚠️ | Manual session start |
| Any CLI tool | ✅ | ❌ | Commits tracked only |

### Benefits

- ✅ **Agent agnostic** - Works with ANY agent
- ✅ **Survives crashes** - Git history is durable
- ✅ **Team collaboration** - Multi-agent tracking
- ✅ **Offline-first** - Git is local
- ✅ **Simple** - Just Git hooks, no complex setup

### Advanced: Session Reconstruction

HtmlGraph can reconstruct session continuity using multiple signals:

**1. Explicit continuation**:
```python
session = sdk.sessions.start(continued_from="session-s1")
```

**2. Commit graph analysis**:
```python
# Find sessions between two commits
sessions = sdk.find_sessions_between("abc123", "def456")
```

**3. Feature-based linking**:
```python
# All sessions that worked on a feature
sessions = sdk.get_feature_sessions("feature-auth-001")
```

**4. Time-based proximity**:
```python
# Sessions within time window
sessions = sdk.find_proximate_sessions(
    datetime.now(),
    window_minutes=60
)
```
