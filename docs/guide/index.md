## Common Workflows

### Creating a Simple Feature

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

sdk = SDK(agent="claude")
feature = sdk.features.create(
    title="Add login page",
    priority="high",
    steps=["Create component", "Add routing", "Write tests"]
)
```

### Creating a Complex Track

```python
track = sdk.tracks.builder() \
    .title("User Authentication") \
    .with_spec(overview="Full auth system") \
    .with_plan_phases([
        ("Phase 1", ["OAuth setup (2h)", "JWT middleware (3h)"])
    ]) \
    .create()
```

### Linking Features to Tracks

```python
# Create features for the track
auth_feature = sdk.features.create(
    title="OAuth Setup",
    track_id=track.track_id
)

jwt_feature = sdk.features.create(
    title="JWT Middleware",
    track_id=track.track_id
)
```

### Starting a Session

Sessions are automatically managed by HtmlGraph hooks:

```bash
# Session starts automatically when you begin working
htmlgraph feature start feature-001

# View session status
htmlgraph status

# Session ends automatically when you complete the feature
htmlgraph feature complete feature-001
```
