# /htmlgraph:research

Perform structured research before planning implementation. Uses WebSearch to gather best practices, patterns, and solutions from the web.

## Usage

```
/htmlgraph:research <topic> [--spike SPIKE_ID]
```

## Parameters

- `topic` (required): What you want to research (e.g., "OAuth 2.0 implementation patterns")
- `--spike` (optional): Spike ID to attach research findings to


## Examples

```bash
/htmlgraph:research "Real-time WebSocket best practices"
```
Research WebSocket patterns and document findings

```bash
/htmlgraph:research "JWT token security 2025" --spike spike-abc123
```
Research JWT security and attach findings to existing spike


## Instructions for Claude

**CRITICAL: This command MUST be used before planning complex features.**

This command implements the mandatory research phase from PARALLEL_WORKFLOW.md. Research reduces:
- Implementation mistakes (learn from others' experiences)
- Context usage (targeted research vs reading entire codebases)
- Time waste (proven patterns vs trial-and-error)

### Implementation:

```python
**DO THIS:**

1. **Parse the research topic:**
   - Extract the main topic from user input
   - Identify 2-3 specific research questions to answer

2. **Perform web searches:**
   Use WebSearch to gather information:

   ```
   Search 1: "{topic} best practices 2025"
   Search 2: "{topic} implementation patterns"
   Search 3: "{topic} common pitfalls"
   ```

   For each search:
   - Read top 3-5 sources
   - Extract key insights
   - Note relevant libraries/tools
   - Identify common patterns
   - Document anti-patterns to avoid

3. **Structure findings:**
   Organize research into:
   - **Key Insights:** Main takeaways (3-5 bullet points)
   - **Recommended Approach:** Preferred pattern/solution
   - **Libraries/Tools:** Specific packages to consider
   - **Anti-Patterns:** What to avoid
   - **References:** Links to sources

4. **Document research:**

   If spike provided:
   ```python
   from htmlgraph import SDK
   sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

   with sdk.spikes.edit(spike_id) as spike:
       spike.add_finding("Research Topic", structured_findings)
       spike.complete_step(0)  # Mark research step done
   ```

   Otherwise, present findings in structured format

5. **Validate research quality:**
   Check that findings include:
   - ✅ At least 3 different sources
   - ✅ Specific recommendations (not vague)
   - ✅ Modern practices (2024-2025)
   - ✅ Code examples or patterns
   - ✅ Links to sources

6. **Suggest next steps:**
   - If spike exists → "Complete spike steps, then use /htmlgraph:plan"
   - If no spike → "Use /htmlgraph:plan to create track from findings"
```

### WebSearch Integration Pattern

**IMPORTANT: Use WebSearch systematically, not ad-hoc.**

Good research workflow:
```python
# 1. Define specific questions
questions = [
    "What are OAuth 2.0 best practices in 2025?",
    "Which Python OAuth libraries are most maintained?",
    "What are common OAuth security vulnerabilities?"
]

# 2. Search for each question
findings = []
for question in questions:
    result = WebSearch(query=question)
    findings.append(extract_insights(result))

# 3. Synthesize findings
structured = synthesize_findings(findings)

# 4. Validate completeness
if not has_sufficient_depth(structured):
    perform_deeper_search()
```

### Quality Checklist

Before completing research, verify:

- [ ] **Breadth:** Covered multiple aspects (implementation, security, performance)
- [ ] **Depth:** Specific recommendations, not generic advice
- [ ] **Currency:** Sources from 2024-2025, not outdated
- [ ] **Practical:** Code examples or concrete patterns
- [ ] **Traceable:** Links to all sources
- [ ] **Structured:** Findings organized clearly
- [ ] **Actionable:** Can create implementation plan from research

### When to Use Research

**ALWAYS use research for:**
- ✅ New technical areas (OAuth, WebSockets, etc.)
- ✅ Security-critical features (auth, encryption)
- ✅ Performance-sensitive work (real-time, high-traffic)
- ✅ Third-party integrations (APIs, services)
- ✅ Architecture decisions (database choice, patterns)

**SKIP research for:**
- ❌ Simple CRUD operations (well-known patterns)
- ❌ Internal refactoring (codebase-specific)
- ❌ Minor UI tweaks (no external patterns needed)
- ❌ Bug fixes (debug, don't research)

### Output Format:

```
## Research Complete: {topic}

**Duration:** {time_spent}
**Sources:** {source_count}
**Quality:** ✅ Validated

### Summary
{2-3 sentence executive summary}

### Recommended Approach
{1-2 paragraphs on preferred solution}

### Key Findings
{structured findings - see template above}

### Next Steps
{context-specific recommendations}
```

### Integration with Planning Workflow

The complete planning workflow is:

```
1. /htmlgraph:research "{topic}"          → Gather best practices
2. /htmlgraph:plan "{description}" --spike → Create planning spike
3. [Complete spike steps]                  → Design solution
4. [Create track from plan]                → Structure implementation
5. [Create features from track]            → Execute work
```

**Example end-to-end:**

```bash
# Step 1: Research
/htmlgraph:research "OAuth 2.0 implementation with FastAPI"

# Research finds:
# - Use authlib library (most maintained)
# - Implement PKCE for security
# - Cache tokens in Redis
# - Use refresh token rotation

# Step 2: Create spike with research context
/htmlgraph:plan "User Authentication System" --spike --timebox 4

# Step 3: During spike, use research to:
# - Define requirements (from best practices)
# - Choose libraries (from research)
# - Design architecture (from patterns)
# - Identify risks (from anti-patterns)

# Step 4: Create track from spike
# Uses SDK.create_track_from_plan() with spike findings

# Step 5: Implement features
# With confidence from research-backed design
```

### Research-First Principle

**Why research before planning?**

1. **Avoid reinventing wheels** - Use proven patterns
2. **Learn from others' mistakes** - Avoid known pitfalls
3. **Choose right tools** - Know library landscape
4. **Design better APIs** - Follow modern conventions
5. **Estimate accurately** - Understand complexity
6. **Reduce context usage** - Targeted vs exploratory reads

**Impact on context efficiency:**

Without research:
- Read 20+ files to understand patterns → 50K tokens
- Trial-and-error implementation → 30K tokens
- Debug unknown issues → 20K tokens
- **Total: ~100K tokens**

With research:
- WebSearch 3-5 queries → 10K tokens
- Focused implementation from patterns → 20K tokens
- Fewer debugging iterations → 5K tokens
- **Total: ~35K tokens (65% savings)**

### Validation Flag

After research, set a validation flag:

```python
research_metadata = {
    "topic": topic,
    "completed": datetime.now(),
    "sources_count": len(sources),
    "validated": True,
    "findings_hash": hash(findings)  # For tracking updates
}
```

This enables smart_plan() to check if research was performed.
