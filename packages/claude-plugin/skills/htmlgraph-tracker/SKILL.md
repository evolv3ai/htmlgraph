# HtmlGraph Tracker Skill

Use this skill when HtmlGraph is tracking the session to ensure proper activity attribution and documentation. This skill should be activated at session start via the SessionStart hook.

## When to Activate This Skill

- At the start of every session when HtmlGraph plugin is enabled
- When the user asks about tracking, features, or session management
- When drift detection warnings appear
- When the user mentions htmlgraph, features, sessions, or activity tracking
- When discussing work attribution or documentation

**Trigger keywords:** htmlgraph, feature tracking, session tracking, drift detection, activity log, work attribution, feature status, session management

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. **Use SDK, Not MCP Tools** (CRITICAL)

**IMPORTANT: For Claude Code, use the Python SDK directly instead of MCP tools.**

**Why SDK over MCP:**
- ✅ **No context bloat** - MCP tool schemas consume precious tokens
- ✅ **Runtime discovery** - Explore all operations via Python introspection
- ✅ **Type hints** - See all available methods without schemas
- ✅ **More powerful** - Full programmatic access, not limited to 3 MCP tools
- ✅ **Faster** - Direct Python, no JSON-RPC overhead

The SDK provides access to ALL HtmlGraph operations without adding tool definitions to your context.

**ABSOLUTE RULE: You must NEVER use Read, Write, or Edit tools on `.htmlgraph/` HTML files.**

AI agents MUST use the SDK (or API/CLI for special cases) to ensure all HTML is validated through Pydantic + justhtml.

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**
```python
# NEVER DO THIS
Write('/path/to/.htmlgraph/features/feature-123.html', ...)
Edit('/path/to/.htmlgraph/sessions/session-456.html', ...)
with open('.htmlgraph/features/feature-123.html', 'w') as f:
    f.write('<html>...</html>')
```

✅ **REQUIRED - Use SDK (BEST CHOICE FOR AI AGENTS):**
```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# Work with ANY collection (features, bugs, chores, spikes, epics, phases)
sdk.features    # Features with builder support
sdk.bugs        # Bug reports
sdk.chores      # Maintenance tasks
sdk.spikes      # Investigation spikes
sdk.epics       # Large bodies of work
sdk.phases      # Project phases

# Create features (fluent interface)
feature = sdk.features.create("Title") \
    .set_priority("high") \
    .add_steps(["Step 1", "Step 2"]) \
    .save()

# Edit ANY collection (auto-saves)
with sdk.features.edit("feature-123") as f:
    f.status = "done"

with sdk.bugs.edit("bug-001") as bug:
    bug.status = "in-progress"
    bug.priority = "critical"

# Vectorized batch updates (efficient!)
sdk.bugs.batch_update(
    ["bug-001", "bug-002", "bug-003"],
    {"status": "done", "resolution": "fixed"}
)

# Query across collections
high_priority = sdk.features.where(status="todo", priority="high")
in_progress_bugs = sdk.bugs.where(status="in-progress")

# All collections have same interface
sdk.chores.mark_done(["chore-1", "chore-2"])
sdk.spikes.assign(["spike-1"], agent="claude")
```

**Why SDK is best:**
- ✅ 3-16x faster than CLI (no process startup)
- ✅ Type-safe with auto-complete
- ✅ Context managers (auto-save)
- ✅ Vectorized batch operations
- ✅ Works offline (no server needed)
- ✅ Supports ALL collections (features, bugs, chores, spikes, epics, etc.)

✅ **ALTERNATIVE - Use CLI (for one-off commands):**
```bash
# CLI is slower (400ms startup per command) but convenient for one-off queries
uv run htmlgraph feature create/start/complete
uv run htmlgraph status
```

⚠️ **AVOID - API/curl (use only for remote access):**
```bash
# Requires server + network overhead, only use for remote access
curl -X PATCH localhost:8080/api/features/feat-123 -d '{"status": "done"}'
```

**Why this matters:**
- Direct file edits bypass Pydantic validation
- Bypass justhtml HTML generation (can create invalid HTML)
- Break the SQLite index sync
- Skip event logging and activity tracking
- Can corrupt graph structure and relationships

**Exception:** You MAY read `.htmlgraph/` files to view content, but NEVER write or edit them.

**Documentation:** See `AGENTS.md` for complete SDK guide and best practices.

### 2. Feature Awareness (MANDATORY)
You MUST always know which feature(s) are currently in progress:
- Check active features at session start (use `uv run htmlgraph status`)
- Reference the current feature when discussing work
- Alert immediately if work appears to drift from the assigned feature

### 3. Step Completion (CRITICAL)
**Mark each step complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing it:**
- Use SDK to complete individual steps as you finish them
- Step 0 = first step, step 1 = second step (0-based indexing)
- Do NOT wait until all steps are done - mark each one as you finish
- See "How to Mark Steps Complete" section below for exact commands

### 4. Continuous Tracking (CRITICAL)

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: ALL work MUST be tracked in HtmlGraph.**

Think of HtmlGraph tracking like Git commits - you wouldn't do work without committing it, and you shouldn't do work without tracking it.

**Every time you complete work, update HtmlGraph immediately:**
- ✅ Finished a step? → Mark it complete in SDK
- ✅ Fixed a bug? → Update bug status
- ✅ Discovered a decision? → Document it in the feature
- ✅ Changed approach? → Note it in activity log
- ✅ Completed a task? → Mark feature/bug/chore as done

**Why this matters:**
- Attribution ensures work isn't lost across sessions
- Links between sessions and features preserve context
- Drift detection helps catch scope creep early
- Analytics show real progress, not guesses

**The hooks track tool usage automatically**, but YOU must:
1. Start features before working (`uv run htmlgraph feature start <id>`)
2. Mark steps complete as you finish them (use SDK)
3. Complete features when done (`uv run htmlgraph feature complete <id>`)

### 5. Activity Attribution
HtmlGraph automatically tracks tool usage, but you should:
- Use descriptive summaries in Bash `description` parameter
- Reference feature IDs in commit messages
- Mention the feature context when starting new tasks

### 6. Documentation Habits
For every significant piece of work:
- Summarize what was done and why
- Note any decisions made and alternatives considered
- Record blockers or dependencies discovered

## Working with Tracks, Specs, and Plans

### What Are Tracks?

**Tracks are high-level containers for multi-feature work** (conductor-style planning):
- **Track** = Overall initiative with multiple related features
- **Spec** = Detailed specification with requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Plan** = Implementation plan with phases and estimated tasks
- **Features** = Individual work items linked to the track

**When to create a track:**
- Work involves 3+ related features
- Need high-level planning before implementation
- Multi-phase implementation
- Coordination across multiple sessions or agents

**When to skip tracks:**
- Single feature work
- Quick fixes or enhancements
- Direct implementation without planning phase

---

### Creating Tracks with TrackBuilder (PRIMARY METHOD)

**IMPORTANT: Use the TrackBuilder for deterministic track creation with minimal effort.**

The TrackBuilder provides a fluent API that auto-generates IDs, timestamps, file paths, and HTML files.

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# Create complete track with spec and plan in one command
track = sdk.tracks.builder() \
    .title("User Authentication System") \
    .description("Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT") \
    .priority("high") \
    .with_spec(
        overview="Add secure authentication with OAuth 2.0 support for Google and GitHub",
        context="Current system has no authentication. Users need secure login with session management.",
        requirements=[
            ("Implement OAuth 2.0 flow", "must-have"),
            ("Add JWT token management", "must-have"),
            ("Create user profile endpoint", "should-have"),
            "Add password reset functionality"  # Defaults to "must-have"
        ],
        acceptance_criteria=[
            ("Users can log in with Google/GitHub", "OAuth integration test passes"),
            "JWT tokens expire after 1 hour",
            "Password reset emails sent within 5 minutes"
        ]
    ) \
    .with_plan_phases([
        ("Phase 1: OAuth Setup", [
            "Configure OAuth providers (1h)",
            "Implement OAuth callback (2h)",
            "Add state verification (1h)"
        ]),
        ("Phase 2: JWT Integration", [
            "Create JWT signing logic (2h)",
            "Add token refresh endpoint (1.5h)",
            "Implement token validation middleware (2h)"
        ]),
        ("Phase 3: User Management", [
            "Create user profile endpoint (3h)",
            "Add password reset flow (4h)",
            "Write integration tests (3h)"
        ])
    ]) \
    .create()

# Output:
# ✓ Created track: track-20251221-220000
#   - Spec with 4 requirements
#   - Plan with 3 phases, 9 tasks

# Files created automatically:
# .htmlgraph/tracks/track-20251221-220000/index.html  (track metadata)
# .htmlgraph/tracks/track-20251221-220000/spec.html   (specification)
# .htmlgraph/tracks/track-20251221-220000/plan.html   (implementation plan)
```

**TrackBuilder Features:**
- ✅ Auto-generates track IDs with timestamps
- ✅ Creates index.html, spec.html, plan.html automatically
- ✅ Parses time estimates from task descriptions `"Task (2h)"`
- ✅ Validates requirements and acceptance criteria via Pydantic
- ✅ Fluent API with method chaining
- ✅ Single `.create()` call generates everything

---

### Linking Features to Tracks

After creating a track, link features to it:

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# Get the track ID from the track you created
track_id = "track-20251221-220000"

# Create features and link to track
oauth_feature = sdk.features.create("OAuth Integration") \
    .set_track(track_id) \
    .set_priority("high") \
    .add_steps([
        "Configure OAuth providers",
        "Implement OAuth callback",
        "Add state verification"
    ]) \
    .save()

jwt_feature = sdk.features.create("JWT Token Management") \
    .set_track(track_id) \
    .set_priority("high") \
    .add_steps([
        "Create JWT signing logic",
        "Add token refresh endpoint",
        "Implement validation middleware"
    ]) \
    .save()

# Features are now linked to the track
# Query features by track:
track_features = sdk.features.where(track=track_id)
print(f"Track has {len(track_features)} features")
```

**The track_id field:**
- Links features to their parent track
- Enables track-level progress tracking
- Used for querying related features
- Automatically indexed for fast lookups

---

### Track Workflow Example

**Complete workflow from track creation to feature completion:**

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# 1. Create track with spec and plan
track = sdk.tracks.builder() \
    .title("API Rate Limiting") \
    .description("Protect API endpoints from abuse") \
    .priority("critical") \
    .with_spec(
        overview="Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse",
        context="Current API has no limits, vulnerable to DoS attacks",
        requirements=[
            ("Implement token bucket algorithm", "must-have"),
            ("Add Redis for distributed limiting", "must-have"),
            ("Create rate limit middleware", "must-have")
        ],
        acceptance_criteria=[
            ("100 requests/minute per API key", "Load test passes"),
            "429 status code when limit exceeded"
        ]
    ) \
    .with_plan_phases([
        ("Phase 1: Core", ["Token bucket (3h)", "Redis client (1h)"]),
        ("Phase 2: Integration", ["Middleware (2h)", "Error handling (1h)"]),
        ("Phase 3: Testing", ["Unit tests (2h)", "Load tests (3h)"])
    ]) \
    .create()

# 2. Create features from plan phases
for phase_idx, (phase_name, tasks) in enumerate([
    ("Core Implementation", ["Implement token bucket", "Add Redis client"]),
    ("API Integration", ["Create middleware", "Add error handling"]),
    ("Testing & Validation", ["Write unit tests", "Run load tests"])
]):
    feature = sdk.features.create(phase_name) \
        .set_track(track.id) \
        .set_priority("critical") \
        .add_steps(tasks) \
        .save()
    print(f"✓ Created feature {feature.id} for track {track.id}")

# 3. Work on features
# Start first feature
first_feature = sdk.features.where(track=track.id, status="todo")[0]
with sdk.features.edit(first_feature.id) as f:
    f.status = "in-progress"

# ... do the work ...

# Mark steps complete as you finish them
with sdk.features.edit(first_feature.id) as f:
    f.steps[0].completed = True

# Complete feature when done
with sdk.features.edit(first_feature.id) as f:
    f.status = "done"

# 4. Track progress
track_features = sdk.features.where(track=track.id)
completed = len([f for f in track_features if f.status == "done"])
print(f"Track progress: {completed}/{len(track_features)} features complete")
```

## Working with HtmlGraph

**RECOMMENDED:** Use the Python SDK for AI agents (cleanest, fastest, most powerful)

### Python SDK (PRIMARY INTERFACE - Use This!)

The SDK supports ALL collections with a unified interface. Use it for maximum performance and type safety.

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

# Initialize (auto-discovers .htmlgraph)
sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# ===== ALL COLLECTIONS SUPPORTED =====
# Features (with builder support)
feature = sdk.features.create("User Authentication") \
    .set_priority("high") \
    .add_steps([
        "Create login endpoint",
        "Add JWT middleware",
        "Write tests"
    ]) \
    .save()

# Bugs
with sdk.bugs.edit("bug-001") as bug:
    bug.status = "in-progress"
    bug.priority = "critical"

# Chores, Spikes, Epics - all work the same way
chore = sdk.chores.where(status="todo")[0]
spike_results = sdk.spikes.all()
epic_steps = sdk.epics.get("epic-001").steps

# ===== EFFICIENT BATCH OPERATIONS =====
# Mark multiple items done (vectorized!)
sdk.bugs.mark_done(["bug-001", "bug-002", "bug-003"])

# Assign multiple items to agent
sdk.features.assign(["feat-001", "feat-002"], agent="claude")

# Custom batch updates (any attributes)
sdk.chores.batch_update(
    ["chore-001", "chore-002"],
    {"status": "done", "agent_assigned": "claude"}
)

# ===== CROSS-COLLECTION QUERIES =====
# Find all in-progress work
in_progress = []
for coll_name in ['features', 'bugs', 'chores', 'spikes', 'epics']:
    coll = getattr(sdk, coll_name)
    in_progress.extend(coll.where(status='in-progress'))

# Find low-lift tasks
for item in in_progress:
    if hasattr(item, 'steps'):
        for step in item.steps:
            if not step.completed and 'document' in step.description.lower():
                print(f"📝 {item.id}: {step.description}")
```

**SDK Performance (vs CLI):**
- Single query: **3x faster**
- 5 queries: **9x faster**
- 10 batch updates: **16x faster**

### CLI (For One-Off Commands Only)

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `uv run` when running htmlgraph commands to ensure the correct environment.

⚠️ CLI is slower than SDK (400ms startup per command). Use for quick one-off queries only.

```bash
# Check Current Status
uv run htmlgraph status
uv run htmlgraph feature list

# Start Working on a Feature
uv run htmlgraph feature start <feature-id>

# Set Primary Feature (when multiple are active)
uv run htmlgraph feature primary <feature-id>

# Complete a Feature
uv run htmlgraph feature complete <feature-id>
```

**When to use CLI vs SDK:**
- CLI: Quick one-off shell command
- SDK: Everything else (faster, more powerful, better for scripts)

## Feature Creation Decision Framework

**CRITICAL**: Use this framework to decide when to create a feature vs implementing directly.

### Quick Decision Rule

Create a **FEATURE** if ANY apply:
- Estimated >30 minutes of work
- Involves 3+ files
- Requires new automated tests
- Affects multiple components
- Hard to revert (schema, API changes)
- Needs user/API documentation

Implement **DIRECTLY** if ALL apply:
- Single file, obvious change
- <30 minutes work
- No cross-system impact
- Easy to revert
- No tests needed
- Internal/trivial change

### Decision Tree (Quick Reference)

```
User request received
  ├─ Bug in existing feature? → See Bug Fix Workflow in WORKFLOW.md
  ├─ >30 minutes? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ 3+ files? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ New tests needed? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ Multi-component impact? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ Hard to revert? → CREATE FEATURE
  └─ Otherwise → IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY
```

### Examples

**✅ CREATE FEATURE:**
- "Add user authentication" (multi-file, tests, docs)
- "Implement session comparison view" (new UI, Playwright tests)
- "Fix attribution drift algorithm" (complex, backend tests)

**❌ IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY:**
- "Fix typo in README" (single file, trivial)
- "Update CSS color" (single file, quick, reversible)
- "Add missing import" (obvious fix, no impact)

### Default Rule

**When in doubt, CREATE A FEATURE.** Over-tracking is better than losing attribution.

See `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for the complete decision framework with detailed criteria, thresholds, and edge cases.

## Session Workflow Checklist

**MANDATORY: Follow this checklist for EVERY session. No exceptions.**

### Session Start (DO THESE FIRST)
1. ✅ Activate this skill (done automatically)
2. ✅ **RUN:** `uv run htmlgraph status` - Check what's active
3. ✅ Review active features and decide if you need to create a new one
4. ✅ Greet user with brief status update
5. ✅ **DECIDE:** Create feature or implement directly? (use decision framework below)
6. ✅ **If creating feature:** Use SDK or run `uv run htmlgraph feature start <id>`

### During Work (DO CONTINUOUSLY)
1. ✅ Feature MUST be marked "in-progress" before you write any code
2. ✅ **CRITICAL:** Mark each step complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing it (use SDK)
3. ✅ Document ALL decisions as you make them
4. ✅ Test incrementally - don't wait until the end
5. ✅ Watch for drift warnings and act on them immediately

#### How to Mark Steps Complete

**IMPORTANT:** After finishing each step, mark it complete using the SDK:

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# Mark step 0 (first step) as complete
with sdk.features.edit("feature-id") as f:
    f.steps[0].completed = True

# Mark step 1 (second step) as complete
with sdk.features.edit("feature-id") as f:
    f.steps[1].completed = True

# Or mark multiple steps at once
with sdk.features.edit("feature-id") as f:
    f.steps[0].completed = True
    f.steps[1].completed = True
    f.steps[2].completed = True
```

**Step numbering is 0-based** (first step = 0, second step = 1, etc.)

**When to mark complete:**
- ✅ IMMEDIATELY after finishing a step
- ✅ Even if you continue working on the feature
- ✅ Before moving to the next step
- ❌ NOT at the end when all steps are done (too late!)

**Example workflow:**
1. Start feature: `uv run htmlgraph feature start feature-123`
2. Work on step 0 (e.g., "Design models")
3. **MARK STEP 0 COMPLETE** → Use SDK: `with sdk.features.edit("feature-123") as f: f.steps[0].completed = True`
4. Work on step 1 (e.g., "Create templates")
5. **MARK STEP 1 COMPLETE** → Use SDK: `with sdk.features.edit("feature-123") as f: f.steps[1].completed = True`
6. Continue until all steps done
7. Complete feature: `uv run htmlgraph feature complete feature-123`

### Session End (MUST DO BEFORE MARKING COMPLETE)
1. ✅ **RUN TESTS:** `uv run pytest` - All tests MUST pass
2. ✅ **VERIFY ATTRIBUTION:** Check that activities are linked to correct feature
3. ✅ **CHECK STEPS:** ALL feature steps MUST be marked complete
4. ✅ **CLEAN CODE:** Remove all debug code, console.logs, TODOs
5. ✅ **COMMIT WORK:** Git commit your changes IMMEDIATELY (allows user rollback)
   - Do this BEFORE marking the feature complete
   - Include the feature ID in the commit message
6. ✅ **COMPLETE FEATURE:** Use SDK or run `uv run htmlgraph feature complete <id>`
7. ✅ **UPDATE EPIC:** If part of epic, mark epic step complete

**REMINDER:** Completing a feature without doing all of the above means incomplete work. Don't skip steps.

## Handling Drift Warnings

When you see a drift warning like:
> Drift detected (0.74): Activity may not align with feature-self-tracking

Consider:
1. **Is this expected?** Sometimes work naturally spans multiple features
2. **Should you switch features?** Use `uv run htmlgraph feature primary <id>` to change attribution
3. **Is the feature scope wrong?** The feature's file patterns or keywords may need updating

## Session Continuity

At the start of each session:
1. Review previous session summary (if provided)
2. Note current feature progress
3. Identify what remains to be done
4. Ask the user what they'd like to work on

At the end of each session:
1. The SessionEnd hook will generate a summary
2. All activities are preserved in `.htmlgraph/sessions/`
3. Feature progress is updated automatically

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
Include feature context:
```
feat(feature-id): Description of the change

- Details about what was done
- Why this approach was chosen

🤖 Generated with Claude Code
```

### Task Descriptions
When using Bash tool, always provide a description:
```bash
# Good - descriptive
Bash(description="Install dependencies for auth feature")

# Bad - no context
Bash(command="npm install")
```

### Decision Documentation
When making architectural decisions:

1. Track with `uv run htmlgraph track "Decision" "Chose X over Y because Z"`
2. Or note in the feature's HTML file under activity log

## Dashboard Access

View progress visually:
```bash
uv run htmlgraph serve
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

The dashboard shows:
- Kanban board with feature status
- Session history with activity logs
- Graph visualization of dependencies

## Key Files

- `.htmlgraph/features/` - Feature HTML files (the graph nodes)
- `.htmlgraph/sessions/` - Session HTML files with activity logs
- `index.html` - Dashboard (open in browser)

## Integration Points

HtmlGraph hooks track:
- **SessionStart**: Creates session, provides feature context
- **PostToolUse**: Logs every tool call with attribution
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Logs user queries
- **SessionEnd**: Finalizes session with summary

All data is stored as HTML files - human-readable, git-friendly, browser-viewable.
