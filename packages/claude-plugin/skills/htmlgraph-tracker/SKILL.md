Use when working with HtmlGraph-enabled projects, when drift warnings appear, or when the user asks about tracking features or sessions.

# HtmlGraph Tracker Skill

Use this skill when HtmlGraph is tracking the session to ensure proper activity attribution and documentation. This skill should be activated at session start via the SessionStart hook.

## When to Activate This Skill

- At the start of every session when HtmlGraph plugin is enabled
- When the user asks about tracking, features, or session management
- When drift detection warnings appear
- When the user mentions htmlgraph, features, sessions, or activity tracking
- When discussing work attribution or documentation

**Trigger keywords:** htmlgraph, feature tracking, session tracking, drift detection, activity log, work attribution, feature status, session management

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Feature Awareness
Always be aware of which feature(s) are currently in progress:
- Check active features at session start
- Reference the current feature when discussing work
- Alert if work appears to drift from the assigned feature

### 2. Activity Attribution
HtmlGraph automatically tracks tool usage, but you should:
- Use descriptive summaries in Bash `description` parameter
- Reference feature IDs in commit messages
- Mention the feature context when starting new tasks

### 3. Documentation Habits
For every significant piece of work:
- Summarize what was done and why
- Note any decisions made and alternatives considered
- Record blockers or dependencies discovered

## Working with Features

### Check Current Status
```bash
htmlgraph status
htmlgraph feature list
```

### Start Working on a Feature
```bash
htmlgraph feature start <feature-id>
```

### Set Primary Feature (when multiple are active)
```bash
htmlgraph feature primary <feature-id>
```

### Complete a Feature
```bash
htmlgraph feature complete <feature-id>
```

## Feature Creation Decision Framework

**CRITICAL**: Use this framework to decide when to create a feature vs implementing directly.

### Quick Decision Rule

Create a **FEATURE** if ANY apply:
- Estimated >30 minutes of work
- Involves 3+ files
- Requires new automated tests
- Affects multiple components
- Hard to revert (schema, API changes)
- Needs user/API documentation

Implement **DIRECTLY** if ALL apply:
- Single file, obvious change
- <30 minutes work
- No cross-system impact
- Easy to revert
- No tests needed
- Internal/trivial change

### Decision Tree (Quick Reference)

```
User request received
  ├─ Bug in existing feature? → See Bug Fix Workflow in WORKFLOW.md
  ├─ >30 minutes? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ 3+ files? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ New tests needed? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ Multi-component impact? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ Hard to revert? → CREATE FEATURE
  └─ Otherwise → IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY
```

### Examples

**✅ CREATE FEATURE:**
- "Add user authentication" (multi-file, tests, docs)
- "Implement session comparison view" (new UI, Playwright tests)
- "Fix attribution drift algorithm" (complex, backend tests)

**❌ IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY:**
- "Fix typo in README" (single file, trivial)
- "Update CSS color" (single file, quick, reversible)
- "Add missing import" (obvious fix, no impact)

### Default Rule

**When in doubt, CREATE A FEATURE.** Over-tracking is better than losing attribution.

See `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for the complete decision framework with detailed criteria, thresholds, and edge cases.

## Handling Drift Warnings

When you see a drift warning like:
> Drift detected (0.74): Activity may not align with feature-self-tracking

Consider:
1. **Is this expected?** Sometimes work naturally spans multiple features
2. **Should you switch features?** Use `htmlgraph feature primary <id>` to change attribution
3. **Is the feature scope wrong?** The feature's file patterns or keywords may need updating

## Session Continuity

At the start of each session:
1. Review previous session summary (if provided)
2. Note current feature progress
3. Identify what remains to be done
4. Ask the user what they'd like to work on

At the end of each session:
1. The SessionEnd hook will generate a summary
2. All activities are preserved in `.htmlgraph/sessions/`
3. Feature progress is updated automatically

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
Include feature context:
```
feat(feature-id): Description of the change

- Details about what was done
- Why this approach was chosen

```

### Task Descriptions
When using Bash tool, always provide a description:
```bash
# Good - descriptive
Bash(description="Install dependencies for auth feature")

# Bad - no context
Bash(command="npm install")
```

### Decision Documentation
When making architectural decisions:
1. Track with `htmlgraph track "Decision" "Chose X over Y because Z"`
2. Or note in the feature's HTML file under activity log

## Dashboard Access

View progress visually:
```bash
htmlgraph serve
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

The dashboard shows:
- Kanban board with feature status
- Session history with activity logs
- Graph visualization of dependencies

## Key Files

- `.htmlgraph/features/` - Feature HTML files (the graph nodes)
- `.htmlgraph/sessions/` - Session HTML files with activity logs
- `index.html` - Dashboard (open in browser)

## Integration Points

HtmlGraph hooks track:
- **SessionStart**: Creates session, provides feature context
- **PostToolUse**: Logs every tool call with attribution
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Logs user queries
- **SessionEnd**: Finalizes session with summary

All data is stored as HTML files - human-readable, git-friendly, browser-viewable.
