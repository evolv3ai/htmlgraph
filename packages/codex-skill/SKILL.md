# HtmlGraph Tracker Skill for Codex CLI

Use this skill when HtmlGraph is tracking your session to ensure proper activity attribution and documentation.

## When to Use This Skill

- At the start of every session when HtmlGraph is initialized
- When working on features, bugs, or other tracked work items
- When the user asks about tracking, features, or session management
- When you need to mark work as complete or update progress

---

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. **Use SDK, Not Direct File Edits** (CRITICAL)

**ABSOLUTE RULE: You must NEVER use file operations on `.htmlgraph/` HTML files.**

All HtmlGraph operations MUST use the SDK via Bash to ensure validation through Pydantic + justhtml.

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**
```bash
# NEVER DO THIS
echo '<html>...</html>' > .htmlgraph/features/feature-123.html
sed -i 's/todo/done/' .htmlgraph/features/feature-123.html
```

✅ **REQUIRED - Use SDK via Bash:**
```bash
# Install HtmlGraph
uv pip install htmlgraph

# Check status
uv run htmlgraph status

# Start feature
uv run htmlgraph feature start feat-123

# Complete step using SDK
uv run python -c "
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='codex')
with sdk.features.edit('feat-123') as f:
    f.steps[0].completed = True
"

# Complete feature
uv run htmlgraph feature complete feat-123
```

**Why this matters:**
- Direct file edits bypass Pydantic validation
- Bypass justhtml HTML generation (can create invalid HTML)
- Break the SQLite index sync
- Skip event logging and activity tracking
- Can corrupt graph structure and relationships

**Exception:** You MAY read `.htmlgraph/` files to view content, but NEVER write or edit them.

---

### 2. **Feature Awareness** (MANDATORY)

You MUST always know which feature(s) are currently in progress:

```bash
# Check at session start
uv run htmlgraph status
uv run htmlgraph feature list

# View feature details
uv run python -c "
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='codex')
features = sdk.features.where(status='in-progress')
for f in features:
    print(f'{f.id}: {f.title} - {len([s for s in f.steps if s.completed])}/{len(f.steps)} steps')
"
```

Reference the current feature when discussing work and alert immediately if work appears to drift from the assigned feature.

---

### 3. **Step Completion** (CRITICAL)

**Mark each step complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing it:**

```python
# Use SDK to mark steps complete
uv run python -c "
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='codex')

# Mark step 0 (first step) as complete
with sdk.features.edit('feature-id') as f:
    f.steps[0].completed = True

# Or mark multiple steps at once
with sdk.features.edit('feature-id') as f:
    f.steps[0].completed = True
    f.steps[1].completed = True
    f.steps[2].completed = True
"
```

**Step numbering is 0-based** (first step = 0, second step = 1, etc.)

**When to mark complete:**
- ✅ IMMEDIATELY after finishing a step
- ✅ Even if you continue working on the feature
- ✅ Before moving to the next step
- ❌ NOT at the end when all steps are done (too late!)

---

### 4. **Continuous Tracking** (CRITICAL)

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: ALL work MUST be tracked in HtmlGraph.**

Think of HtmlGraph tracking like Git commits - you wouldn't do work without committing it, and you shouldn't do work without tracking it.

**Every time you complete work, update HtmlGraph immediately:**
- ✅ Finished a step? → Mark it complete via SDK
- ✅ Fixed a bug? → Update bug status
- ✅ Discovered a decision? → Document it in the feature
- ✅ Changed approach? → Note it in activity log
- ✅ Completed a task? → Mark feature/bug/chore as done

**Why this matters:**
- Attribution ensures work isn't lost across sessions
- Links between sessions and features preserve context
- Drift detection helps catch scope creep early
- Analytics show real progress, not guesses

---

## Working with HtmlGraph SDK

### Python SDK (PRIMARY INTERFACE)

The SDK supports ALL collections with a unified interface:

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

# Initialize (auto-discovers .htmlgraph)
sdk = SDK(agent="codex")

# ===== ALL COLLECTIONS SUPPORTED =====
# Features (with builder support)
feature = sdk.features.create("User Authentication") \
    .set_priority("high") \
    .add_steps([
        "Create login endpoint",
        "Add JWT middleware",
        "Write tests"
    ]) \
    .save()

# Work with any collection
with sdk.bugs.edit("bug-001") as bug:
    bug.status = "in-progress"
    bug.priority = "critical"

# Query across collections
high_priority = sdk.features.where(status="todo", priority="high")
in_progress_bugs = sdk.bugs.where(status="in-progress")

# Batch operations (efficient!)
sdk.bugs.batch_update(
    ["bug-001", "bug-002", "bug-003"],
    {"status": "done", "resolution": "fixed"}
)
```

### CLI (for one-off commands)

```bash
# Quick status check
uv run htmlgraph status

# Feature management
uv run htmlgraph feature create "New Feature"
uv run htmlgraph feature start feat-123
uv run htmlgraph feature complete feat-123

# List features
uv run htmlgraph feature list --status in-progress
```

---

## Feature Creation Decision Framework

**CRITICAL**: Use this framework to decide when to create a feature vs implementing directly.

### Quick Decision Rule

Create a **FEATURE** if ANY apply:
- Estimated >30 minutes of work
- Involves 3+ files
- Requires new automated tests
- Affects multiple components
- Hard to revert (schema, API changes)
- Needs user/API documentation

Implement **DIRECTLY** if ALL apply:
- Single file, obvious change
- <30 minutes work
- No cross-system impact
- Easy to revert
- No tests needed
- Internal/trivial change

### Decision Tree

```
User request received
  ├─ Bug in existing feature? → Check if needs feature or direct fix
  ├─ >30 minutes? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ 3+ files? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ New tests needed? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ Multi-component impact? → CREATE FEATURE
  ├─ Hard to revert? → CREATE FEATURE
  └─ Otherwise → IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY
```

### Examples

**✅ CREATE FEATURE:**
- "Add user authentication" (multi-file, tests, docs)
- "Implement session comparison view" (new UI, tests)
- "Fix attribution drift algorithm" (complex, backend tests)

**❌ IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY:**
- "Fix typo in README" (single file, trivial)
- "Update CSS color" (single file, quick, reversible)
- "Add missing import" (obvious fix, no impact)

### Default Rule

**When in doubt, CREATE A FEATURE.** Over-tracking is better than losing attribution.

## Session Workflow Checklist

**MANDATORY: Follow this checklist for EVERY session. No exceptions.**

### Session Start (DO THESE FIRST)
1. ✅ Check status: `uv run htmlgraph status`
2. ✅ Review active features and decide if you need to create a new one
3. ✅ Greet user with brief status update
4. ✅ **DECIDE:** Create feature or implement directly? (use decision framework above)
5. ✅ **If creating feature:** Run `uv run htmlgraph feature start <id>`

### During Work (DO CONTINUOUSLY)
1. ✅ Feature MUST be marked "in-progress" before you write any code
2. ✅ **CRITICAL:** Mark each step complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing it (use SDK)
3. ✅ Document ALL decisions as you make them
4. ✅ Test incrementally - don't wait until the end
5. ✅ Watch for drift warnings and act on them immediately

### How to Mark Steps Complete

```python
uv run python -c "
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='codex')

# Mark step as complete
with sdk.features.edit('feature-123') as f:
    f.steps[0].completed = True  # Mark first step complete
"
```

### Session End (MUST DO BEFORE MARKING COMPLETE)
1. ✅ **RUN TESTS:** All tests MUST pass
2. ✅ **VERIFY ATTRIBUTION:** Check that activities are linked to correct feature
3. ✅ **CHECK STEPS:** ALL feature steps MUST be marked complete
4. ✅ **CLEAN CODE:** Remove all debug code, console.logs, TODOs
5. ✅ **COMMIT:** Git commit with feature ID in message
6. ✅ **COMPLETE FEATURE:** `uv run htmlgraph feature complete <id>`
7. ✅ **UPDATE EPIC:** If part of epic, mark epic step complete

**REMINDER:** Completing a feature without doing all of the above means incomplete work. Don't skip steps.

## SDK Quick Reference

### Installation
```bash
uv pip install htmlgraph
```

### Common Operations

**Check Status:**
```bash
uv run htmlgraph status
```

**Start Feature:**
```bash
uv run htmlgraph feature start feat-123
```

**Complete Step:**
```python
uv run python -c "
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='codex')
with sdk.features.edit('feat-123') as f:
    f.steps[0].completed = True
"
```

**Complete Feature:**
```bash
uv run htmlgraph feature complete feat-123
```

**Query Features:**
```python
uv run python -c "
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='codex')
print(sdk.features.where(status='in-progress'))
"
```

**Batch Operations:**
```python
uv run python -c "
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='codex')
sdk.bugs.batch_update(
    ['bug-001', 'bug-002'],
    {'status': 'done', 'resolution': 'fixed'}
)
"
```

## Key Principles

1. **USE SDK FOR ALL OPERATIONS** - Never edit .htmlgraph/ files directly
2. **TRACK CONTINUOUSLY** - Update progress as you work, not at the end
3. **MARK STEPS IMMEDIATELY** - Complete each step as you finish it
4. **CREATE FEATURES FOR NON-TRIVIAL WORK** - Use the decision framework
5. **VERIFY BEFORE COMPLETION** - All tests pass, all steps done, clean code
